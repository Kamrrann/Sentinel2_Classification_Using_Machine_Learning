# Land use and land cover classification from Sentinel-2 imagery using machine learning

This repository provides a comprehensive guide on performing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification on Sentinel-2 multispectral images using finely-tuned Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. The process involves training a well-optimized RF model and subsequently applying the pre-trained model to map LULC in Sentinel-2 imagery. All the implementation will be carried out using Python programming within the jupyter notebook, and the RF will be implemented using the scikit-learn open-source ML library.


# Key Features


## Random Forest Model Training 
Implement a well-optimized RF model using scikit-learn, emphasizing parameter tuning and optimization.

## Model Evaluation
 Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices.

## Inference and Mapping
Apply the pre-trained RF model to classify LULC in Sentinel-2 imagery and generate visual maps.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites

 Python

 Jupyter Notebook or another Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) depends on your preferences
 
Required Python libraries (specified in notebook)

# Deployment

## Explore the Notebook
